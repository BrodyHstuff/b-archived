when you treat me so unkind
what goes on in your mind?
the other day i saw you
as i walked along the road
but when i saw him with you
i could feel my future fold
it's so easy for a girl like you to lie
tell me why
what goes on in your heart?
what goes on in your mind?
you are tearing me apart
when you treat me so unkind
what goes on in your mind?
i met you in the morning
waiting for the tides of time
but now the tide is turning

when i think of all the times i tried so hard to leave her
she will turn to me and start to cry
and she promises the earth to me and i believe her
after all this time i don't know why
ah, girl, girl, girl

when friends are there,
you feel a fool
when you say she's looking good
she acts as if it's understood.
she's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh
ah, girl, girl, girl
was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
did she understand it when they said
that a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
will she still believe it when he's dead?

your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
you don't sound different, i've learned the game
i'm looking through you, you're not the same
why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?

there i will go
ooh ooh ooh ah ah

       "she's leaving home"
wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
silently closing her bedroom door
leaving the note that she hoped would say more
she goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
quietly turning the backdoor key
stepping outside she is free
she (we gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)
home (we gave her everything money could buy)
she's leaving home after living alone
for so many years (bye bye)
father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
picks up the letter that's lying there
standing alone at the top of the stairs
she breaks down and cries to her husband "daddy our baby's gone
why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
how could she do this to me?"
she (we never thought of ourselves)
is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
she's leaving home after living alone
for so many years (bye bye)
friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
waiting to keep the appointment she made
meeting a man from the motor trade
she (what did we do that was wrong)
is having (we didn't know it was wrong)
fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
something inside that was always denied
for so many years (bye bye)
she's leaving home
bye bye

       "within you without you"
we were talking about the space between us all
and the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
we were talking about the love we all could share
when we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
with our love, we could save the world, if they only knew
try to realise it's all within yourself
no one else can make you change
and to see you're really only very small
and life flows on within you and without you
we were talking about the love that's gone so cold
and the people who gain the world and lose their soul
they don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?
when you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
peace of mind is waiting there
and the time will come when you see we're all one
and life flows on within you and without you

will you still need me, will you still feed me
when i'm sixty four?
you'll be older too
and if you say the word
i could stay with you
i could be handy, mending a fuse
when your lights have gone

doing the garden, digging the weeds
who could ask for more?
will you still need me, will you still feed me
when i'm sixty four?
every summer we can rent a cottage in the isle of wight
if it's not too dear
we shall scrimp and save
grandchildren on your knee

stating point of view
indicate precisely what you mean to say
yours sincerely, wasting away

nothing can come between us
when it gets dark i tow your heart away
standing by a parking meter
when i caught a glimpse of rita
filling in a ticket in her little white book
in a cap she looked much older
and the bag across her shoulder
made her look a little like a military man
lovely rita meter maid
may i inquire discreetly (lovely rita)
when are you free to take some tea with me? (lovely rita, maid, ah)
rita!
took her out and tried to win her
had a laugh and over dinner

got the bill and rita paid it
took her home i nearly made it
sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
oh, lovely rita meter maid

i read the news today, oh boy
about a lucky man who made the grade
and though the news was rather sad
well, i just had to laugh
i saw the photograph
he blew his mind out in a car;
he didn't notice that the lights had changed
a crowd of people stood and stared
they'd seen his face before
nobody was really sure if he was from the house of lords
i saw a film today, oh boy;
the english army had just won the war
a crowd of people turned away
but i just had to look
having read the book
i'd love to turn you on
woke up, fell out of bed
dragged a comb across my head
found my way downstairs and drank a cup
and looking up, i noticed i was late
found my coat and grabbed my hat
made the bus in seconds flat
found my way upstairs and had a smoke
and somebody spoke and i went into a dream
ah i read the news today, oh boy
four thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire
and though the holes were rather small
they had to count them all
now they know how many holes it takes to fill the albert hall
i'd love to turn you on

day after day, alone on a hill
the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
but nobody wants to know him
they can see that he's just a fool
and he never gives an answer
but the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
and the eyes in his head
see the world spinning 'round
well on the way, head in a cloud
the man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
but nobody ever hears him
or the sound he appears to make
and he never seems to notice
but the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
and the eyes in his head
see the world spinning 'round
and nobody seems to like him
they can tell what he wants to do
and he never shows his feelings
but the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
and the eyes in his head
see the world spinning 'round
he never listens to them
he knows that they're the fools
they don't like him
the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down

in penny lane there is a barber showing photographs
of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
and all the people that come and go
stop and say hello
on the corner is a banker with a motorcar
the little children laugh at him behind his back
and the banker never wears a mac
in the pouring rain, very strange
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit, and meanwhile back
in penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
and in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
he likes to keep his fire engine clean
it's a clean machine
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
a four of fish and finger pies
in summer, meanwhile back
behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
the pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
and though she feels as if she's in a play
she is anyway
in penny lane the barber shaves another customer
we see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
and then the fireman rushes in
from the pouring rain, very strange
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit, and meanwhile back
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes

i'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, i'm telling you
you know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
and when i see your smile replace every thoughtless frown
got me escaping from this zoo, baby, i'm in love with you
i'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when i'm with you
if i grow up i'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger
not worrying what they or you say i'll live and love and maybe someday
who knows, baby, you may comfort me
i may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject
i'm changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
who knows, baby, you may comfort me
i want that love of yours, to miss that love is something i'd hate
i'll make an early start, i'm making sure that i'm not late
for you sweet top lip i'm in the queue, baby, i'm in love with you
