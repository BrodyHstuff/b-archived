she acts as if it's understood.
she's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh
ah, girl, girl, girl
was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?

then we'd lie beneath the shady tree
i love her and she's loving me
she feels good, she knows she's looking fine
i'm so proud to know that she is mine.
good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine
good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine
good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine
good day...
       "and your bird can sing"
you tell me that you've got everything you want
and your bird can sing
but you don't get me, you don't get me
you say you've seen seven wonders and your bird is green
but you can't see me, you can't see me
when your prized possessions start to weigh you down
look in my direction, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round
when your bird is broken will it bring you down
you may be awoken, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round
you tell me that you've heard every sound there is
and your bird can swing
but you can't hear me, you can't hear me
       "for no one"
your day breaks, your mind aches
you find that all her words of kindness linger on
when she no longer needs you
she wakes up, she makes up
she takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
she no longer needs you
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years
you want her, you need her
and yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
you think she needs you
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years
you stay home, she goes out
she says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
she doesn't need him
your day breaks, your mind aches
there will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
you won't forget her
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years

       "i want to tell you"
i want to tell you
my head is filled with things to say
when you're here
all those words, they seem to slip away
when i get near you
the games begin to drag me down
it's alright
i'll make you maybe next time around
but if i seem to act unkind
it's only me, it's not my mind
that is confusing things
i want to tell you
i feel hung up but i don't know why
i don't mind
i could wait forever, i've got time
sometimes i wish i knew you well,
then i could speak my mind and tell you
maybe you'd understand
i want to tell you
i feel hung up but i don't know why
i don't mind
i could wait forever, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time
       "got to get you into my life"
i was alone, i took a ride
i didn't know what i would find there
another road where maybe i could see another kind of mind there
ooh, then i suddenly see you
ooh, did i tell you i need you
every single day of my life
you didn't run, you didn't lie
you knew i wanted just to hold you
and had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
for i had told you
ooh, you were meant to be near me
ooh, and i want you to hear me
say we'll be together every day
got to get you into my life
what can i do, what can i be
when i'm with you i want to stay there
if i'm true i'll never leave
and if i do i know the way there
ooh, then i suddenly see you
ooh, did i tell you i need you
every single day of my life
got to get you into my life
got to get you into my life
i was alone, i took a ride
i didn't know what i would find there
another road where maybe i could see another kind of mind there
then suddenly i see you
did i tell you i need you
every single day?
       "tomorrow never knows"
turn off your mind, relax and float down stream
it is not dying, it is not dying
lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
it is shining, it is shining
yet you may see the meaning of within
it is being, it is being
love is all and love is everyone
it is knowing, it is knowing...
... that ignorance and hates may mourn the dead
it is believing, it is believing
but listen to the colour of your dreams
it is not living, it is not living
so play the game "existence" to the end...
... of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning

picture yourself in a boat on a river
with tangerine trees and marmalade skies
somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
a girl with kaleidoscope eyes
cellophane flowers of yellow and green
towering over your head
look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
and she's gone
lucy in the sky with diamonds

aaaaahhhhh...
follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
that grow so incredibly high
newspaper taxis appear on the shore
waiting to take you away
climb in the back with your head in the clouds
and you're gone

       "she's leaving home"
wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
silently closing her bedroom door
leaving the note that she hoped would say more
she goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
quietly turning the backdoor key
stepping outside she is free
she (we gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)
home (we gave her everything money could buy)
she's leaving home after living alone
for so many years (bye bye)
father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
picks up the letter that's lying there
standing alone at the top of the stairs
she breaks down and cries to her husband "daddy our baby's gone
why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
how could she do this to me?"
she (we never thought of ourselves)
is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
she's leaving home after living alone
for so many years (bye bye)
friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
waiting to keep the appointment she made
meeting a man from the motor trade
she (what did we do that was wrong)
is having (we didn't know it was wrong)
fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
something inside that was always denied
for so many years (bye bye)
she's leaving home
bye bye

       "within you without you"
we were talking about the space between us all
and the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
we were talking about the love we all could share
when we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
with our love, we could save the world, if they only knew
try to realise it's all within yourself
no one else can make you change
and to see you're really only very small
and life flows on within you and without you
we were talking about the love that's gone so cold
and the people who gain the world and lose their soul
they don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?
when you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
peace of mind is waiting there
and the time will come when you see we're all one
and life flows on within you and without you
       "when i'm sixty four"
when i get older losing my hair
many years from now

birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
if i'd been out till quarter to three
would you lock the door?
will you still need me, will you still feed me
when i'm sixty four?
you'll be older too
and if you say the word
i could stay with you
i could be handy, mending a fuse
when your lights have gone
you can knit a sweater by the fireside
sunday mornings go for a ride
doing the garden, digging the weeds
who could ask for more?
will you still need me, will you still feed me
when i'm sixty four?
every summer we can rent a cottage in the isle of wight
if it's not too dear
we shall scrimp and save
grandchildren on your knee
vera, chuck and dave
send me a postcard, drop me a line
stating point of view
indicate precisely what you mean to say
yours sincerely, wasting away
give me your answer, fill in a form
mine forevermore
will you still need me, will you still feed me
when i'm sixty four?

nothing can come between us
when it gets dark i tow your heart away
standing by a parking meter
when i caught a glimpse of rita
filling in a ticket in her little white book
in a cap she looked much older
and the bag across her shoulder
made her look a little like a military man
lovely rita meter maid
may i inquire discreetly (lovely rita)
when are you free to take some tea with me? (lovely rita, maid, ah)
rita!
took her out and tried to win her
had a laugh and over dinner
told her i would really like to see her again
got the bill and rita paid it
took her home i nearly made it
sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
oh, lovely rita meter maid
where would i be without you
give us a wink and make me think of you (lovely rita meter maid)
lovely rita meter maid, rita meter maid (lovely rita meter maid)

i read the news today, oh boy
about a lucky man who made the grade
and though the news was rather sad
well, i just had to laugh
i saw the photograph
he blew his mind out in a car;
he didn't notice that the lights had changed
a crowd of people stood and stared
they'd seen his face before
nobody was really sure if he was from the house of lords
i saw a film today, oh boy;
the english army had just won the war
a crowd of people turned away
but i just had to look
having read the book
i'd love to turn you on
woke up, fell out of bed
dragged a comb across my head
found my way downstairs and drank a cup
and looking up, i noticed i was late
found my coat and grabbed my hat
made the bus in seconds flat
found my way upstairs and had a smoke
and somebody spoke and i went into a dream
ah i read the news today, oh boy
four thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire
and though the holes were rather small
they had to count them all
now they know how many holes it takes to fill the albert hall

the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
but nobody wants to know him
they can see that he's just a fool

the man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
but nobody ever hears him
or the sound he appears to make
and he never seems to notice
but the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
and the eyes in his head
see the world spinning 'round
and nobody seems to like him
they can tell what he wants to do
and he never shows his feelings
but the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
and the eyes in his head
see the world spinning 'round
he never listens to them
he knows that they're the fools
they don't like him

misunderstanding all you see
it's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
it doesn't matter much to me
let me take you down, cause i'm going to strawberry fields
nothing is real and nothing to get hung about

       "penny lane"
in penny lane there is a barber showing photographs
of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
and all the people that come and go
stop and say hello
on the corner is a banker with a motorcar
the little children laugh at him behind his back
and the banker never wears a mac
in the pouring rain, very strange
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit, and meanwhile back
in penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
and in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
he likes to keep his fire engine clean
it's a clean machine
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
a four of fish and finger pies
in summer, meanwhile back
behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
the pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
and though she feels as if she's in a play
she is anyway
in penny lane the barber shaves another customer
we see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
and then the fireman rushes in
from the pouring rain, very strange
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit, and meanwhile back
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
